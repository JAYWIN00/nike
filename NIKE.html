        The world’s largest athletic apparel company, Nike is best known for its footwear, apparel, and equipment. Founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, the company became Nike in 1971 after the Greek goddess of victory. One of the most valuable brands among sport businesses, Nike employs over 76,000 people worldwide. It sells its apparel through the Nike brand, as well as its Jordan Brand and Converse subsidiaries.

            The company sponsors top athletes and sports teams around the world, including LeBron James, Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, and Alex Morgan. In 2021 the company announced plans to begin refurbishing returned sneakers to sell at a lower price as part of an attempt to reduce consumer waste and combat climate change.

        One of Nike’s most recent innovations is a shoe that can be electronically paired up to a smartphone. The footwear contains a computing device that is embedded into it and can be connected to the smartphone of whoever is wearing the shoes.
